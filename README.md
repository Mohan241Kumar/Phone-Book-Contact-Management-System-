# 📞 Contact Management System

## Overview

<p align="justify">
The Contact Management System is a lightweight and user-friendly terminal-based program written in C. It allows users to store, view, search, and delete contact information such as name, phone number, email, and Facebook ID. This simple phone book application is built using a singly linked list data structure and demonstrates essential CRUD operations.

## Abstract

<p align="justify">
This project is a command-line utility designed to manage a limited set of contacts (up to 5) in memory. Each contact contains a name, mobile number, Gmail ID, and Facebook profile. The system uses dynamic memory allocation and linked lists to store the contacts in a flexible and memory-efficient manner. It provides a clean, menu-driven interface for interaction and is ideal for beginners learning data structures and fileless data handling in C.
